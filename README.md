## Overview

- Display pressure sensors and their relation and failures data in the dashboard by line, box, and area charts.
- When a failure is predicted we will show the details of it in tables.
- View the T-statistics and P-value of the 3 failures for every pressure sensor.

## sections

### About

- provide an in-depth overview of the project, its objectives, and the benefits we aim to achieve.
- It explains the purpose of the project, highlighting the key goals.
- Introduces the team behind the project.

### Historical Analysis

- The charts show the pressure sensorsâ€™ value in a certain period, and the relation between its and failures.
- Show the minimum, maximum, average, and standard division for the Pressure sensors.

### Statistical Analysis:

- Detailed table that displays the T-Statistic and P-Value for Failure1, Failure2, and Failure3 for each pressure sensor.
- This analysis helps in identifying statistically significant factors that contribute to failures, allowing us to focus on the most critical areas for intervention.

### Real-Time Analysis

- Sensor logs involve continuously monitoring and displaying data captured by various sensors.
- This process is visualized using dynamic line and area charts.
- The charts refresh automatically as new data is received from the sensors, ensuring that the displayed information is always up-to-date.

### Failures predictions

- The admin doesn't need to check the Failures Predictions section every 6 hours to ensure if any failure or not, because when any failure exists we view the number of failures next to the section in the sidebar.
- When a failure is found we will show it inside the table containing the type of failure, timestamp, and the Pressure Sensor value.
